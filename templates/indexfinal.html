					<h3 class="text-center thin">Checkout these relevant factors</h3>
					
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 highlight">
							<div class="h-caption"><h4><i class="fa fa-smile-o fa-5"></i>Engine CC</h4></div>
							<div class="h-body text-center">
								<p>Engine size is the volume of fuel and air that can be pushed through a car's cylinders and is measured in cubic centimetres (cc). Car engine sizes are normally specified in litres.A car that has a 1390cc engine would be described as a 1.4 litre.Larger engines or higher CC engines burn more fuel and produce more power. Therefore, larger engines are more powerful and can accelerate faster than smaller engines.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 highlight">
							<div class="h-caption"><h4><i class="fa fa-smile-o fa-5"></i>Power</h4></div>
							<div class="h-body text-center">
								<p>BHP is pretty much the power of an engine in simple terms. The Brake Horse Power is the unit of power of an engine without any losses like heat and noise.The BHP determines the acceleration and top speed of a vehicle. Often fast and quick vehicles will focus more on the BHP than the torque.In general the more horsepower a car has the higher its top speed is, and the faster it can accelerate to 60 mph. </p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 highlight">
							<div class="h-caption"><h4><i class="fa fa-smile-o fa-5"></i>KM driven</h4></div>
							<div class="h-body text-center">
								<p>Benefits of low km used cars : Theoretically, the lower odometer reading the car has, the longer life expectancy of the engine and most components of the vehicle. If the car's odometer hits six figures, oil leaks can start cropping up plus the eventual wearing out of some key and expensive parts like the timing belt.A good car is 15,000 km a year, so if you can find a 10-year-old car that has done 150,000 kilometres, that's a good car. </p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 highlight">
							<div class="h-caption"><h4><i class="fa fa-smile-o fa-5"></i>Dealers vs Individual</h4></div>
							<div class="h-body text-center">
								<p> While a dealer needs to make a profit on each vehicle, a private seller doesn't have the same concern. Instead, private sellers are usually trying to sell an old vehicle so they can buy a new one, and that means they're often more willing to negotiate just to ensure that the car is sold quickly.While the dealerships offer you a wide variety of cars, their prices are often higher as compared to the private sellers. In general, cars sold by dealers ensures more guarantee than by Individuals</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 highlight">
							<div class="h-caption"><h4><i class="fa fa-smile-o fa-5"></i>Fuel type</h4></div>
							<div class="h-body text-center">
								<p>Currently, the majority of cars worldwide are powered by gasoline/petrol, diesel or compressed natural gas (CNG). There are also cars that use a hybrid of different power sources. Among these CNG is the most economical followed by diesel the petrol.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 highlight">
							<div class="h-caption"><h4><i class="fa fa-smile-o fa-5"></i>Year</h4></div>
							<div class="h-body text-center">
								<p>It’s a good idea to consider the age of a vehicle and the number on its odometer.It’s more important that the car you are going to buy is not aged well.A 10-year-old car with 100,000 miles may have received more TLC than a five-year-old model with 50,000 miles. </p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 highlight">
							<div class="h-caption"><h4><i class="fa fa-smile-o fa-5"></i>Transmission</h4></div>
							<div class="h-body text-center">
								<p>Basically, automatic transmissions are easier to use and more comfortable for the driver, while manual transmission vehicles are less expensive and more involved. Of course, there are exceptions to any rule and the only way to be sure which one is right for you is to go for a test drive</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 highlight">
							<div class="h-caption"><h4><i class="fa fa-smile-o fa-5"></i>Car brand</h4></div>
							<div class="h-body text-center">
								<p>A strong car brand can create significant value in the automotive industry. The price consumers expect to pay for otherwise identical luxury vehicles can vary as much as $4,000, depending on the car's brand. For mass-market cars, brand helps determine which products a consumer considers buying.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 highlight">
							<div class="h-caption"><h4><i class="fa fa-smile-o fa-5"></i>Mileage</h4></div>
							<div class="h-body text-center">
								<p>Mileage is the number of miles or the average distance that a vehicle can travel on a specified quantity of fuel.It is expressed in kmpl. A car with high mileage is preferable and economical than with low mileage.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 highlight">
							<div class="h-caption"><h4><i class="fa fa-smile-o fa-5"></i>Number of owners</h4></div>
							<div class="h-body text-center">
								<p>The number of owners on the car has had has a very prominent effect on its resale value. The logic behind this factor is that the more the number of owners there, the higher is the possibility of the car being used roughly.</p>
